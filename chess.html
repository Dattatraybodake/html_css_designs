            <h1>Extra Information</h1>
            <p>
Anand has won the Mainz Chess Classic, a Category 21 Championship, a record 11 times. 
In 2008, he defeated Carlsen en route to his 11th title in that event.<br>

Anand is the first player to have won five titles of the Corus chess tournament. 
He is the first player to have won each of the Big Three supertournaments at the time: 
Corus (1989, 1998, 2003, 2004, 2006), Linares (1998, 2007, 2008), and Dortmund (1996, 2000, 2004).
<br>
Anand has a stellar record at the annual Melody Amber Tournament 
(2 separate and unique Blindfold and Rapid Chess supertournaments played): he has 5 overall prizes
(winning in 1994, 1997, 2003, 2005, and 2006), and has the most "rapidplay" titles, winning 9 times. 
He is also the only player to win the blind and rapid sections of the tournament in the same year 
(twice, in 1997 and 2005).
<br>
Anand won three consecutive Advanced Chess tournaments in Leon, Spain, 
after Kasparov introduced this form of chess in 1998, and is widely recognised as the 
world's best Advanced Chess player, where players may consult a computer to aid in their 
calculation of variations.
<br>
Anand's collection My Best Games of Chess was published in 1998 and updated in 2001. 
His individual tournament successes include the Corus chess tournament in 2006 
(tied with Topalov), Dortmund in 2004, and Linares in 2007 and 2008.<br> In 2007 he won the 
Grenkeleasing Rapid championship for the tenth time, defeating Levon Aronian.
Just a few days before, Aronian had defeated Anand in the Chess960 final.
<br>
In March 2007, Anand won the Linares chess tournament and it was widely believed that
he would be ranked world No. 1 in the FIDE Elo rating list for April 2007. But Anand was 
No.2 on the initial list released because the Linares result was not included. 
FIDE subsequently announced that Linares would be included,
pushing Anand to number one in the April 2007 list.
